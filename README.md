# some-image-processing
image compression, edge detection and image segmentation by k-means algorithm with matlab
# Image Compression
compress an image by discrete cosine transform
# Edge Detection
edge detection by sobel algorithm with automatic threshold
# Image Segmentation
to separate human from the background, using k-means algorithm to do binary classification

so, k is 2
